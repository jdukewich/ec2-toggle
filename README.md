# EC2 Toggle

EC2 Toggle provides a way for multiple users to manage turning on/off an AWS EC2 instance. The primary intended use case for this is 
to use with an EC2 running a Minecraft server to help save money. Whoever creates and maintains the server can allow others to toggle the server on/off when the want to play in order to help save costs.
